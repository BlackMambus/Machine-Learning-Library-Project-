# Machine-Learning-Library-Project-

A machine learning (ML) library is a collection of pre-built tools, algorithms, and functions that allow developers and data scientists to build, train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models efficientlyâ€”without having to reinvent the wheel.

ðŸ”§ Core Capabilities

Algorithm Support: Includes supervised (e.g. regression, classification), unsupervised (e.g. clustering, dimensionality reduction), and reinforcement learning techniques

Model Training & Evaluation: Tools to split datasets, train models, validate performance, and fine-tune parameters

Preprocessing Utilities: Functions for data cleaning, scaling, encoding, and transformation

Visualization: Charts and plots to interpret results and monitor training progress

Integration: Can work with other libraries (e.g. NumPy, Pandas) or frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow, PyTorch)

Deployment Tools: Some ML libraries include support to export models for use in apps or cloud services
